# Renewable-Energy-of-Kazakhstan
The objective of this project is to assess the renewable energy potential of Kazakhstan by analyzing historical data on solar radiation and wind speeds. This assessment aims to identify the most promising regions for renewable energy development and to forecast future energy output using advanced time series forecasting models.

1.	Abstract
Kazakhstan, with its vast steppes and diverse climatic conditions, holds significant potential for renewable energy development. This thesis aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the solar and wind energy resources in Kazakhstan, analyzing their potential to contribute to the country's energy mix. By leveraging historical meteorological data, advanced forecasting techniques, and spatial analysis, this study evaluates the viability of harnessing these renewable resources and provides a roadmap for future development.
The research begins with an extensive literature review to contextualize Kazakhstan's current energy landscape and the role of renewable energy within it. Our methodological approach includes data collection from meteorological stations, data preprocessing and feature engineering, statistical data analysis, and data visualizations the use of forecasting models such as Prophet model, LSTM (Long short-term memory) model and XGBoost model to predict future solar energy outputs. The results highlight regions with the highest solar and wind energy potential, particularly the southern regions for solar energy and central and northern regions for wind energy.
Forecasts and analysis indicate that solar and wind energy production in Kazakhstan will increase significantly over the next decade, driven by technological advancements and strategic investments. This growth could reduce Kazakhstan's reliance on fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance energy security. Our findings have important implications for policymakers, investors, and stakeholders in the energy sector, offering valuable insights into how Kazakhstan can transition to a more sustainable and diversified energy system. The study concludes with recommendations for future research and policy initiatives to support the growth of renewable energy in Kazakhstan, emphasizing the need for continued data collection, technological innovation, and supportive regulatory frameworks.
