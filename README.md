# Renewable-Energy-of-Kazakhstan
The objective of this project is to assess the renewable energy potential of Kazakhstan by analyzing historical data on solar radiation and wind speeds. This assessment aims to identify the most promising regions for renewable energy development and to forecast future energy output using advanced time series forecasting models.

## 	Abstract
Kazakhstan, with its vast steppes and diverse climatic conditions, holds significant potential for renewable energy development. This thesis aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the solar and wind energy resources in Kazakhstan, analyzing their potential to contribute to the country's energy mix. By leveraging historical meteorological data, advanced forecasting techniques, and spatial analysis, this study evaluates the viability of harnessing these renewable resources and provides a roadmap for future development.
The research begins with an extensive literature review to contextualize Kazakhstan's current energy landscape and the role of renewable energy within it. Our methodological approach includes data collection from meteorological stations, data preprocessing and feature engineering, statistical data analysis, and data visualizations the use of forecasting models such as Prophet model, LSTM (Long short-term memory) model and XGBoost model to predict future solar energy outputs. The results highlight regions with the highest solar and wind energy potential, particularly the southern regions for solar energy and central and northern regions for wind energy.
Forecasts and analysis indicate that solar and wind energy production in Kazakhstan will increase significantly over the next decade, driven by technological advancements and strategic investments. This growth could reduce Kazakhstan's reliance on fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance energy security. Our findings have important implications for policymakers, investors, and stakeholders in the energy sector, offering valuable insights into how Kazakhstan can transition to a more sustainable and diversified energy system. The study concludes with recommendations for future research and policy initiatives to support the growth of renewable energy in Kazakhstan, emphasizing the need for continued data collection, technological innovation, and supportive regulatory frameworks.

### Research Methodology
To achieve the research objective, we employed a combination of data acquisition, analysis, and forecasting techniques. The methodology involves several key steps:
Data Collection: We utilized the Atlite library to gather historical data on solar radiation and wind speeds across Kazakhstan. Atlite allows for the conversion of online weather data into energy system data, facilitating the analysis of renewable energy potential. The data was sourced from the ERA5 dataset provided by the Copernicus Climate Data Store, covering the year we want.
Data Analysis: Using Python libraries such as pandas and statsmodels, we analyzed the collected data to determine average and peak values of solar radiation and wind speeds. This analysis helped in identifying regions within Kazakhstan that have the highest potential for renewable energy generation.
The data cleaning process involved removing anomalies and filling missing values to ensure data integrity. Descriptive statistics and geographic information system (GIS) tools were used to map and visualize the spatial distribution of solar and wind resources.

### Forecasting Techniques 
To predict future solar energy output, we applied time series forecasting models, including Prophet model, LSTM (Long short-term memory) model and XGBoost model. These models were chosen for their ability to handle both seasonal and non-seasonal data patterns effectively.
The forecasting process included the following steps:
•	Model Selection: Based on the time series characteristics Prophet model, LSTM model and XGBoost model were selected.
•	Model Training: The models were trained on historical data to optimize parameters and minimize forecasting errors.
•	Forecast Generation: Forecasts for solar and wind energy production were generated for short-term (1 day) and long-term (one week) periods. The forecasts were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R²).

### Tools and Software 
The analysis and forecasting were performed using Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, statsmodels for statistical modeling, and matplotlib for data visualization. These tools provided a robust and reproducible framework for assessing the renewable energy potential in Kazakhstan.
By combining these methodologies, the study aims to provide a detailed and accurate assessment of Kazakhstan's renewable energy resources, supporting informed decision-making and strategic planning for future energy developments.
